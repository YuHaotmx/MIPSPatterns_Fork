# A function with multiple return values but one exit point.
# This is a more advanced topic.
f1:
  # Function prologue, set up stack and save registers.
  addi  $sp, $sp, -20             # Allocate five slots on stack.
  sw    $ra, 0($sp)               # $ra is in the first slot.
  sw    $s0, 4($sp)               # $s0 is in the second slot.

  # Complicated decision making.

_f1Body1:
  # Result code that sets up the return values for the first case.
  # ...

  j     _unwind                   # Jump to cleanup.

_f1Body2:
  # Result code that sets up the return values for the second case.
  # ...

  # Result code that sets up the return values for the third case.

  # Now, since the next instructions are my clean up, we can just fall through.

_unwind:
  # Clean up code.

  # Function epilogue, restorn saved registers and clean up stack.
